## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Side_projects.git
cd Side_projects/<project_folder>
python <script_name>.py
```

> Replace `<project_folder>` and `<script_name>` with actual names such as `contacts_book` and `contact_book.py`.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

Each project reinforces:
- Python fundamentals (control flow, functions, data types)
- CLI interface building
- Dictionary-based data storage
- Error handling & user interaction
- Randomization and modular programming

---

## 🔧 Future Additions

- Add persistence using file I/O or JSON
- Unit tests and edge case handling
- Option to run as a Python module/package
- Enhanced interactivity for flashcard or calculator apps
