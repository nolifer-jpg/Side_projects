# 🧮 CLI Calculator App

A simple command-line calculator built in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations with input validation and error handling.

## 📌 Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- Graceful handling of:
  - Non-numeric inputs
  - Division by zero
- Continuous execution until the user chooses to exit
- Modular design using separate functions for each operation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the `calculator.py` file.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Run:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen menu to perform operations.

## 📂 Sample Menu

```
1. Add  
2. Subtract  
3. Multiply  
4. Divide  
5. Exit  
```

## 🛠 Example Usage

```
What to do? 1  
Enter first number: 12  
Enter second number: 8  
Result: 20
```

## ✅ Dependencies

- Python 3.x

## 📁 File Structure

```
calculator.py
```

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with Python functions
- Handling runtime errors using try/except
- Validating user input in CLI environments
- Structuring code cleanly with reusable functions

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add support for floating point numbers
- Add advanced operations like modulus, exponentiation
- Option to use previous result in next calculation
